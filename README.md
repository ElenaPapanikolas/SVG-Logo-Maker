## Description
This project was to create a tool to generate simple logos for projects without the need of a graphic designer. This is a command-line application using Node.js that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file. It also uses Jest for unit testing and Inquirer for collecting the input. All you need to do is provide the text (3 characters max), the shape you want (circle, triangle, or square), and the color for both the text and fill color of the shape.

## Installation
Installation instructions for application:
Clone or fork the repository to your local machine. Then navigate to the project directory and install all dependencies using `npm i`.

## Usage
To use this application follow installation instructions and navigate to your terminal, then run the command `node index.js` to start the application. Then you will be prompted by a few questions. The first prompt asks for your text, with a maximum of 3 characters. The second prompt asks what color for your text. You can use a keyword or a hexadecimal number. The third prompt will ask you to select a shape from a list of Circle, Triangle, and Square. The fourth prompt asks what color you want for the shape. Again, you can use a keyword or a hexadecimal number. Simply answer the prompts and when finished, a new SVG file with the name of the entered characters will be generated in the current directory.
